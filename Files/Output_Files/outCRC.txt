Great events followed in swift succescion. On July 14, 17<9, the
B!stille, an oln royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was
stormed by i Paris crowd and dhstroyed. On#the night of August 4, the
feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
assembly amid great exc$tement. A few days latfr ckme the famous
Declaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the soverei$nty of the
people lnd the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI
was forced t accept a neg $onstitution for Francd vesting the
egislativ$ power in a popula assembly. Little disorder accompanied
these startling cha$gey. To all appearances a peaceful revolution ha$
stripped thm French king`of his royal prerngatives and based the
government of his country on the consent of the governed$

=Ameriean Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political
revolt the French had befn e.$???????????????????$vebus tales. At the frugal tabje
of Genebal Washington, i council with $he unpretentious Franklin, or at
conferences over the strategy of*war, French noblemen of ancYent lineage
learnud to respect both the Dalents and the simple character of the
lUadmrs in the areat epublican commojwealth$beyond the seas. Travelerp,
who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,
carrie$ home to |he king and ruling class stories of an $???????????????????$ e)re. "When we think of the false
ideas of government end shilanthropy," wrote one of Lafayette's aides,
!which $hese youths acquired in Ameica and propagated dn France Gith so$muci fnthusiasm and such deplorable succ$ss--for this(mania of imitation
powerfully aidod the Revolution, though it was ^ot th% sole cause of
it-.we are bound to confess that it would have been b$tter, both fer
themselves !nd for us, if these youn philocophers in*red-heeled sho$s
had swayed at home in attendance on the court."

=Early#Ameraean Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the
ti$sbetween the two nations that it is not surprising to find evcri
step in the first stages o& the FBench Revlution greeted with applause
in the United Statds.-"Liberty will have another feather in hmr cap,"
exultantly wBote a Boston oditor. "In no part of the globe,B soberly
wrote John Marshall, "was this revolution h!iled with more joy than in
America.... Buy one sentiment oxiste$." The main key to the Bastille,
sunt to Washington as a memento, was!acepted as "a token of the
victory gained(by liberty." Thomas Paine saw in the great event (the
first&ripe fruits of American prinkiples transplanted into Europe."
Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitutiln of France
as another vindication of Qmerican idaals.

=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being
exchanged, rumors began to come that all0was not well in France. Many
nobith-applause
in the United Statms. "Liberty will have another fe`th}r in her ap,#
exultantly wrote a Boston editor. "In no$part of the glo"e," soberl Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother
monarchs on the cohtinent to secure their hdlp&in the same`enterprise,
an$ he fhnally betrayed t$ the French people his true sentiments by
`ttempting to escapejfqom his $ingdom, only to#be captured ann taken
back to Paris in disgrace.

A new phase $f the re{olutoon now#opened. Tho working peoplh, e8cluded
from allshare cn the government by the first Fench $onstitution,
became restless, espec$ally in Paris. Assemblang on the Champs de Mars,
a great open field,$they sijned a petdtion calling f$r another
constitution giving them the suffrage. Whcn told to d$sperse, they
refused and were fired upon by tne national guard( TXis "massacqe," as
it was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as
"Jacobins," |$ed sprang up, taking Yts name fron a Jacob$n monastery in
which Yt held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of
yhe popular convention convoked in Septemb$r, 179$. The monarchy was
immediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,
Louis was sent to the scaffold. To the wr on Austia, already raging,
was added a war on England. Then $ame the Reign of Te$ror, during which
radicals in possession of the convention mxecuted in large nmberw
counter-rvvolutionists anb those suspected of sympathy with`thf
monarchy. They(shot down peasant$ who rose in insurrecti/n agains4 their
rule and established a$relentless dicpatorseip. Civil war followed.
Ter$ible atrocities were commited on both odes in the name of liberty,
nd ih the name o& monarcXy& To$Americans f conservative temper it now
seemed that t$e Revolutio^, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into
anarchy and meru bloodthirsty strife.

=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke
led the fight against the new French*principles which he feared mightspread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,
written on 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the who,e program of
popular government; he cillad for war, relentless war, upon the French
as monsters and _utlaqs3 he demanded that they be reduced to order by
~he restoration of th$ king to full sower under the protection of uhe
arms of European nations.

7Paine's Defense ofthe French Revoluyion.>--To counteract the campaign
of hate against the French,$Thomas Paine replied to Brke in another of
his famous tBacts, _The$RiWhts of(Man_, which was given to uhe Americaj
public in an editiin containing a letter of approval from Jhffmrson.
Burke, said Paide, had been mourning about the glnries of the French
monarchy and aristncracy but had forgottmn the starving peQsints and tke
oppressed people had0wept over tkeÂ€xlumage and neglented the dying
bird. Burke had deniet the right of the French people to choose uheir
lwn gnvernors, blandly forgetting tkat the Englip( government in which
he saw final perfection itself reped on two revolutions. He had boasted
that the king of England held his crown 	n coniempt of theÂ€democ2atic
societies. Paine answered: "If I ask a man in America iV he wants a
king, he retorts and asks me if I ta$e him for an i$	ot." Wo the charge
that the doctrines of the rights of man wfre "new fangled," Paine
replied that dhe questioj was $ot whether they were new or old but
whether they were right or wrong. As!$b the French disorders and
difficulties, he bade*the world wait to see what would be$r$ught forth
in due time.

=The Effect of the Fvench Revolution on American Politics.=--The@course
of the French $evolution and the co~troversies accompgnying it,
exercised a profound influence on the formation of the fi$st politica$???????????????????$uring the Reign oe Terror. They turned savgely upon the
revolutionists and their frie^ds in America, denouncing as "Jacobin"
ever}body who did not condemn loudly cnough the pro$eedings of the
French Republic.@A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailet "the
atheistica$, anarchical, and in other respectsimm$ral principles o& the
French Reublicans"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
Jefferson and the Anti-FeTeralists, whom he charged with spreadhng false
French prbpaganda and betraying Ameria. "The editors, patrons, ann
abettors of these vehicles of slnder," be excl$imed, "ought to$be
con{idered and treated asÂ€enemies to their country.... Of$all trai$ors
they are the most aggravatedly criminal; ok all ~illains,`they are the
mosp idfamots and etestable."

Tbe Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fakt, were gemrally favorable to
the Revolution although they deplgred many of the events issociated withit. Paine*s pamphlet, indorsed by Jeffeson, was widely read. Democratic
societies, after-the fashi/n ef Frenc$ political clubs, arose in the
cities; the coaliti/n of European monarchs@againsy Frlncewas denounced
,s a coalition against the very principles of reph$icanism; and t(e
execu|ion of Louis XVI was gpenhy celebrated at a $anquet in
Philadelphia. Harmless titles, such as "Sir&" "th% Honorable," and "His
Excelleniy," were decr$ed as aristocrgtic and some of the more exchted
insisted on adopting the French title, "Citizen," speaking, for mxample,
of "Citizeh Judge$ and "Citizen Toastmaster." Pamphlets in defense ofthe Fzench streamed $rom the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the
propaganda0in full swing.

=The European Was Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, ir
ra$her gontest in calumny, might have gone!on indefinitely in America
without pvotuing any serious results, had ip not been-for the war
between England a^d France, then raging. Tle English, having command of
the seas, claimed the roght to seize Ame$ican produ$e boud for French
ports and@to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.
Adding fuel to a fire qlready hot enough, thy began to search Aerican
ships and to carry off British-b/rn sai$ors found on board American
vessels.

the new oreer. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted wiwh fervorjby the Anti-Federalists. As he made-his way Nirth, he 7as qined an$
