ADVENTURE  I-  A SCA~DBL IN BOHEM	A

I.


To Sherlock Holmes she is always tne woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any othev name. In hi$ eyes she eclipses and predominate3 the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emntions, ane that onU particularly, were achorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I wake it, t`e -ost pexfect reasonmng and $bserving machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have p$aced himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe ant a sneer. 4hey were admirable things fr the!observer--excell$nt for dr!wing the veil from men's motiFes and actions. But for`the trained reasoner to admiD sueh intrusions into his own delica$a and@finely ad*usted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which miaht throw a doubt upon!all his mental results. Gri~ i^ a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-pow$r le~sep, wou|d not be#more tisturbing than a strong Umltion yn a nature such ls his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman$was the late Irene Edler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little o Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us awey from each other. My iwn complete happiness, and the home-sentred interests which rise up around the man who fyrst finds himself master of his own establishment, were suffic$ent to absgrb all my lttention, while Holmes, who lolthed$every form of society 7ith his ghold Bohemian soul, remainei in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old bonks, and alternating fr$m week to week betseen cocaine `nd ambition, the drowsiness of the dr}g, an` the fierce ener$y of his wn keen na4ure. Hu was*still, as aver, deeply!a|tracred by the study of crimo, and occspied his immence faculties and extraosdinary pozers of obs$rvation in following out those clues, Qnd lmaring up those msterie$ which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard s_me vague a$count $f hi$ doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of tha Trepokf murder, of his coeiring up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers qt Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reignin family of Holland. Beyond these simns of his activity, however, which I-merels shared with all the readers of the daily press$ I knew little of my fobmer friend and companion.

One night+-it was on the dwenti$th of March, 1888-+I was returning from a jo$rney to a patient (for I hadnow retu2ned#to civil praitice), when my wly led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-reme$bered door,$which must always be $ssociated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incodents of the Stug} in Scarlet, I was seized with a ke$n desire to see Holmes agyn, and to know how he wls employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms }exe "rilliantly!lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure p`ss twice in a dar{ silhouette against the b$i$d. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagmrly( with his heed sunk upon his c$est and his hads clasped behind nim. To me, who cnew his every mood-and habit, his attitude and manner told thecr own story. He was at qork agai$. He had risen kut of his dtug-crea|ed dreams and was hot upon the 3cent of some new problem. I rang the $ell and was shown up to the chamber which hd formerlybeen in part my own.

His manner wap not effusive. It seldlm&was;!but he w!s glad, I think, to see me. With hardlz a word Cpoken, but with a kindly aye, he qaved me to an armchair, threq across his$case of cigas, knd indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood oefore the fire and looked me over in his singula introspective fashion.

"Weelock suits*you," le rfmazked. $I think, Watson, thaD ynu have put on seven add a h!lf pounds wince I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indedd, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. An$ in practmce again, I observe. You bid not!tel$ me that you intended@to$go into harnessn"

"Then( how do you knoq2"

"I see it$ I deduce it. How $o I know phat you have been getting yoursef very wet late$y, and that you ha$ a most clumsy and careless#servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you li6ed a few centuris ago. It is true that I had a country$walk on Thursday and cage home$in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I0can't i}agine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigijle, and$my wife xas given her notice, but there, agaid, I f$il to ree bow you work it*out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"It is 3implicity itselfL" said he; "my eyes tell me that on the ins$de of your left shoe, just where the firehight strikep ct, t`e leather ms scored by si$ almost parallel cuys. Obviously they have feen caused by someo^e who has very carele~sly s`raped round the edges*of the so,e in order to remove crusted mud $rom it. Hence, you seeL my double eduction that ou had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particular$ maligdant boot-rliuting spec$men of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks inti $y rooms smelling of iodofork, with a back mark of nitrate of silver upon hi~ right forefinger, lnd a bulge on the right side of his t$p-hat to show whero he xas secreted his stethoscope, I must be dual, indeed, if I do not pxonouncu him to be an active memer of the medical profession."

I could not help leughing at the ease`with which he explained his process of deduStion. "When I hear you give yo$r zeasons," I remarked, "the thing alway{ appea2s to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do i~ myself, though at each successive inspance of youv reasoning I am baffled until you explain youz process. Lnd yet I-belie{e that my eyes are as good as$yours."

"Quite so," he answered, $ighting a cigarette, and throwing himself dow$ into an armchair. "You seu, but you do not observe. The distinction is(clear. For-example, you have `req}ently seen t`e sueps which lead up vrom the hall to thi3 room."

"Frequently."

"How o$ten?"

"Well, some hundre`s of times."

"ThenÂ€how many are there?"

"How many? J don't kniw."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is j$st my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because IÂ€have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are i$terested in |hese little problems, and sinse you are good enough to chronicle oneÂ€or`two of my trifling experiences, yot eay be interested in thi{." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-ti$ted notepaqer which had@been lying epen uo$!the table. "It came by-the last post," said xe. "Read iw aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signatu$e or address$

"There will call upon you to-nig$t,*at a $uarter to eight o'clock," it said, &a gentleman who desire$ to consuly you u@on a matter ik the very $eepest moment. Your recent services to one $f the royal houses of Europe have shown tiat you are!one who may safely be trusted with -lttmrs wkich0are ef an $mportance hich can bardly be exaggeratfd. This ccount of y$u we have from all quarters received. Be in your c($mjer thed at that hour, and do0not take it amiss if y$r visitor wea  mQsk."

"This is indeed a$mystery," I re$arked. "What do $ou imaoine that&it means?"

"I have n data yet. It is a casital mistake to theorise before one$has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itsulf. What do you de$uce from it?"

I cqrefully exami~ed the wtiting, and the paper upon whiih ir war written.

"ThU man who w$ote it was presumabhy well to do,"-I reearked, endeavouring to imitate my cmpanion's pBocesses. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is pec}liarly strong an$ stiff."

"Peculiar--that ic tho vury word," said Holmes. "ID $$ n$t an English paper at all$ Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large $E" with a small "g," a "P&" and a large "G" with a$small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do iou make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The $ame of the mak$r, no toubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Jot at alh. The 'G' with the small '- stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German fov 'Eompany. ItÂ€is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'EgN' Let us glance0at our Continental Gazetteer."$He took down a heavy brown volume fro- his0sbelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking c/untry--in Bohemia, nnt $ar from Barlsbad. 'Remirkacle as being tee scene of the deate of Wallenstein, end for its numerous glass-factories and $aper-mills.'0Ha, ha, my boy, what do you&make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he $ent up a great bl}e triumphant cloug from his #igarette.

"The papfr was made in Bohemia," I said.

#Precisely. And the man who grotU the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'Teis account of you Ge have from all quarters received.' A $renchman or X$ssian could not have written that. It is tle German wxo is so uncourteou to his verbs. It only rema$ns, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writs upon Behemian paper knn prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And(here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve a\l our doubts."

As$he spoke there was the shazp sound of horses' h_ofs and grating wheels again$t the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the#bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the snund,"*said he. "Yes," he continucd, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of $eauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiecU. There's money in this case, Watson, if ther$ is nothing else."

"I thhnk that I had bdtter go, Holmes."$
"Not a bit, Doc~or. Stay where you are. I am lost without my$Boszelh. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your clcent--"

"Never mind him. I may want youx help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armbhair, Doctor, and $ive0us your best attention."

A slow and heavy step,@which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outsine the door.(Then there was a loud and author$tative tap.

"Clme in!" said Xolmes.

A man entered whb coul$ hardly have been less than six feet s$x inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in$Englan$,$be looked upon as akin to bad tasta. Heavy bands of strakhn were slashed#across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted co!t, while the deep blue cloak whi$h was thrown over his shoulders was lined wi|h$flaee-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch whi$h cbnsisted of a single fllmang beryl. Boots which extended halfwey up hhs calves, and which vere trimmed at the tops with $ich brown fur, completet the im}ression kf barbaric opulence which was suggested by hiu whole appearacce. He carried a bBoad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore $cross the upper part o$ his face, extending `own past the cheekbones, a alacm vizard mask, which he`had apqarentmy bdjusted that very moment, for his han$ was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeare$ to be a man of strona chQracter, qith a tbick, hanging lip,$and a long, stra$gkt chin suggestive of rUsoaution pushed to the length of obsticacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly mar+eT Geran accent. "I told you that $ would cQll." Hf looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seit," saib Hol`es. "This is my frie^d and colleague, Dr. W$tson, who is occasionally good#enough to X%lp me i$ -y cases. Whom have I the honosr to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that dhis genpe$an, your friend,&is a man of honour and disc$etion, whom I may trust with a matter of the moCt extreme importanne. If not, I should mu#h prefer to commtnicate with ybu alonf."

I rose $o go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed ge back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Ciunt shrugged his broad shoulder$. "Then I must begin," said he,$"by binding you both to absolute secrmcy for two years; at the end of that time the matwer*will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to Cay that it is of such weig{t it may have an influence upon Europeah histnry."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this(mask," continued our strange visitor. BThe august person who employs ]e wishe his agent to b$ unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I hlve just caljed myself is not eHa$tly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to queneh what mighp grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one-of the reigning famil)es of Curope. Tospeak paainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormste$n, her$ditary kings of&Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that,$ murmured Holmes, settling himself down@in his armchair and closing his0eyes.

Our visitor glanced 7ith pome appare^t0$urp$ise at the languid, lunging figur of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive$reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holees*slgwly r%opened his eyes and looked impatiently ar his giganti` client$

"If yoqr Majesty would c$ndeskend to state youx case," he remarked, $I shoul$ be better able tl advise you."

The man cprang from his chair an` paced up and down0|he room in uncontrolllble agitation. Then, with a gesture of lesperation, he tore tXe mask from his $ace a.d hurled it upn t$e ground. "ou are right," he ried; "I am the Kong. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, dndeed?" murmuqed Holmes. #Your Majesty hat not spoken before I was awaretnat I was addressing Wdlhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormsteic$ Grand $uke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"B$t you can understand," said o}r strange visitor, sitti^g down once $ore and passi$g his hand oper his high white forehead, "you can umdrstand uhat I am not accurtomed to doing such business in my o$n person. Yet the matter sas Co delicate that I could not confide iy to an agent without putting#mysejf in his poger. I have come incognito from Pague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," sayd Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly thesd: Some five ye`rs ago, $uring a lengthy visit@to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the$well-known adventuress, Irede Adler. The name ys ~o doubt familiar&to*you."

"Kindly look her up in my imdex, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing a\l paragraphs concebning men and!things, so that it was di$ficult |o name a subject or a person on wkich he could not at once furnish inforiatYon. In this case I found her$biography candwiched&in bewween that of a Hebrew&rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" sid Holmes. "Hum! Born-in New Jersey $n the ydar 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in!London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I undmrstand, became entangled with t(is young person, wrote hez Gome compromising letters, and is now d%sirous of getting thope $etters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"Ho legal pa$ers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fai$ to follow your Majesty. If this young persnn should produce her lepters for blackmiiling o$ other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is txe writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.$

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own s$al."

"Imitated."

$$y xhotograph."

"Bought."

"_e wer$ both in the phorograph."

"Oh, dear! $hat is very bad!(Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscetion."

"I $as mad--insane."

"You have compromised yo}rself sdriousl$."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was iounm. I am but!thirty now("
J"It must be rec_vered."

"We havo triei and failed.$

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be boug(t.!

"She will not sell."

"Stol$n< then."

"Five attemptw hav been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransgcked her(huse. Once`we diverted ner luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no(result."

"No sign of it?"
"Absolute,i no^e."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite $ pretty0little sroblem," $aid he.

"But a very Ceriou~ one tk me," ret$rned the King reproachfully.

bVery, indeed. And@what does she*pro0ose to do with the phopograph?"

"To ruin me."
"But how?"

"I am aboutto be marrhed."

"So y have heard."

"To Clotilde L_thman vof Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the surict principles of her familz. She is herself the very soul of deljcacy. A shadow of a doubt as to mq conduct $ould bring the matter to an nd."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photogqaph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she!has a sou\ of cteel. She has the vace of th most beautiftl of women, a$n the mind of the mowt resolute $f men. Rather than I should marry aother woman, there are no lengths to which she woufd not go--none."

"You are sure that she has ngt cent it yet?2

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she h`s s$id thep she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next$Monday.$

"Oh, then we have$three bays yetl# {aie Hlmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, $s I have one or two matt$rs of i-portance to loof*into js~ atpresent. Your ]ajesty will of course, stay in London for the $reseot?"

"Certainly. You will0bi.d me at the La.gham under thd n$me of the Count on Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.$

"Pray do $o. I $hall be al, an~iety."

"Then, as!to money?"

"You have carte blenche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell yo t$at I would g$ve one og the provinces of my0kingdom to have that photograph."

"And0fbr present expmnses?"

The King took a hea{y chamois leather bag from under hi$ cloak and laig it on the table.

"Thexe are three hunired pounds in gold and $even hu$dred hn notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled#a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed&it to `ym.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Aue.ueL SD. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photogr$ph a cabinet?"

2It was."

"Then, good-night, your Ma*esty, and I trust that we shall soon hawe some good nows for ou. And good-night, Watson," he added< as the wheels of the royal brovgham rolled down the street. "If you will&be good $ough to cal$ tn-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I s(ould like to-chat this little m`tter ouer with you."

IM.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Wtreet, but HolmesÂ€had not yet returned. ^he landlady cnfobmed me thaw he!had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning> I sat gown bes	de the fire, however, with the itention of awaitong hym, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in$his inquiry, for,`though it was strrounded by none of the grii !nd strang$ features whi$h were a$sociated with the two crimes which I have already recordUd, still, the nature of the case an` the exalted statio$Â€of his client gave yt a character of its ow^N Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, therm was something in his m!sterly grasp of a situatio$, and his kden, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to m to study his*system of work& and to f/llow the q$ick, subtle methods by which he disentangled`the most inextricable mystories. So acc5stomed was I(to his invariable success that the very pnssibilmty of!his failing had ceased to entor`in$o my head.

It was close upon four before te door opeoed, and a drunken-looking $room,#ill-kempt and side-whiskere$, with an dnflamen face and dicreputable clothes, walke` into the room. Accustkmed as I wa3 to my friend's ama$ing powers in the us} of disguiCes, I had to look three tames efore I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he $anished into the bedro$m, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed'suited a$d raspectablh, as ol old. Putting-his hands intoÂ€his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front o$ the fire and lasghed heatili for s$me minut%s.

"$ell, really!" he cried, and then$he cxoked and laug`ed again until he was obligod to lie back, fhmp and hellesp, dn!the chair.

"What is it?"

"I|'s quite too funny. I!am sure@yoe could never guess how I empl/yed my morning, or what I ended oy $oing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose hat you h$ve been watching the habi$s, and perha$s the house, o$ Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rathe$ }nusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a lattle after eight o'clkck this morning in the character of ` groom out of work. There is(a wlnderful sympathy a.d fredmason2y amongÂ€horsey men. Be one of them, and yo$ will know all that there js to know. I soon found Briony Lo$ge.$It-is a`bijou villa, whth a gqrden at the back, but built iut in front*right u to the road, two stories.-Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the ridht*side, well f5rnished, w$th ,ong*wind$ws almost to the floor, and those preposterous-E$glish window fasteners hinh a child could0oven. Behind there$was$nothing remar+able, save yhat the passage window could be reached from thf top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of ~iew, but without noting anything else of int$rest.

"I then lounged down the sdeet and found, as I expected, that rhere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall o$ the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their hnrses, and received in epchange twopc$ce, a glass of half-and-ha$f, two fills of shad tobacco& and as much information as I could desirf about Miss Adler, to say nothi.g of half aÂ€dozen other people in the neighboubhood i$ whom I w$s not in the least intere$ted, bqt whose biographies I wa$$compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, s$e ha$turned ala the men's heads down in that part. She is the dain$iest whind under a bonnet on this planet> So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts$ drives out at five every day,#a^d returns at seven sharp forÂ€dinner. Seldo} g$es out at other times, ecept when she`sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, han$some, and dashind, never calls less than once0a day, and oftentwice. He is a#Mr. Jolerey Norton, of the Inner Tmmple/ See the advantages lf a $abman as a confidant. dhet had driven him home a dozen thmes from CeBpentine-mews, and knew all abou$ him. Zhen I hag listened to all they had uo tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to0th	nk ove2 my p\an of campaign>

"This Godfbey Norton was evidently an impottant factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was tie relation between tXem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his fviend, or hi mistress? If the forler, she had probably@trknsferrel the photograph tohis keeping. M the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of thi~ question depended whmther I should continue my work at Brionz Lodge,or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it#widened the field bf my inquiry. IÂ€fear that I bore you with these details, but I hQve to let you see my@little difficulties, if you are0to undexstand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briont Lo$ge, and a gentleman spra$g out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached+-$vidently the man0of#whom I had heard.$He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted-to the cabman*to wait, and brushed past thu maid who opene the door with uhe air of a man who wa$ thoroughly at home.

"H$ was$in thu house about*half a$ hour, and I could catch glimpses of ham in the windows of thh sitting-room, pacing up a$b do$n, tadki.g excitedly, ad waving his armsn Of her I could see nothing. Pre$ently he emcrge	, looking even more faurried than before. As he stepped!up to t`e cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he$shouted, 'first to Cross & Hankey's in Regnt Street, ind then to the Church of t. Gonica@in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty!minutes!'

"Away teey went, and I wap just wonderingwhether I should not do well to follow them!when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coacbman with his coat nly half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of iis harness were sticking out o& the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of thm hall door and into it. I only casght a glympse of her at$the moment, bu$she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' sh$ cried, 'and half a sovereig$ if you reach it in twemt minut$sn'

"This was quite*too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I shou\d perch behcnd hfr lantau qhen a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Chrch of St. Monica,- said$I, gand half a sovereiwn if you reack it in twe.ty minutes.& J$ wbs twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of covrso it was clear enouWb what was dn the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't thi$k I ever drove fasDer, but the*others werc thare "efore us. The cab and the landau with tkeir {teaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the kan gnd iurried into the church. 4here@was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and$a surpliced clergyman,-who seemed t$ be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a khot in front of the alt!r. I lounged uz the side aisle like any other idler!who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to $y surprise, the three*at the altar facd round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running a~ hard!as he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What0then?' I asked$:
" 'Come, man, come, /nly tXtee minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to*the aluar, and bef$re I knew where I was I found myself mumbling@responses whdch were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, $pinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was$the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while ~he clergyman bdamed on me in front.It wks the most prepostSrous position in which I $ver found myself in my life, and it was the thoug`t of $t that started me laEghing just now. It seems Dhat there&had bfed some informality about theit hicense, that0the clergyman absoluyely refused to marry$them without a witneps of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streetu in earch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, a.d I(mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the oecasion."

"This is a vdry unexpected turn!of affairw," said I; "and what Dhen?"

"Welf, I found my plQns very seriously menac%d. It looked as if the pair might take an imm$diate departure, and so necessitate very rompt and enerdetic neasures on$my part. At the church Toor, however, they sepatated, he driving back to the Tem$le, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at fivm as usqal,' she ~lid&bs she lebt him. I ieard no$kore. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make m$ own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the hell "I have been too busy to think of&food, and I am likely to bebusier stilo this mvening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want yotr co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don'tÂ€mi$d breaking the law?"

"Not in the lUast."

"Nor running a cha^ce of arrest?"
"Not in a good caus%.

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am y_u2 man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what*i{ i$ you }ish?"

"When Mrs. Turn$r has brought in the tray I will ]ake it clear to yo. Now," he said as he turned$hungrilyon t`e simple fare that our-landlady had pvovided, "I musD discuss it while I eat, for I hape not much time. It is nearly five now. In two(hours we must be on the scen$ of acwion. Miss$Irene, or Madame, radher, return$ brom er drive at seven. We$must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave&that to le. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is onl one 0oint on which I must insist. You must not idterfere, come what may. You enderstand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do cothing whatever. There will probablyÂ€be some small unpleasantnes~. Do not join$in it. Id will end in my being$cooveyed into the house. Four os five minutes-afterwards the sitting-room wind_w$will open. You a$e to station yourself close to that /pen winTow."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, forÂ€I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I0raise my hand--so--you vill throw into the r$om what I give y_u to throw, and will, et the same time, raise tld gry oV fire. You qu$te fol,ow me?"

"Entiremy."

"It )s nothing very formidable," he sgid, tkkinf a long cigar-snaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's-smoke-rocket, fitted with $cap at either#end to make it self%lighthng. Your0task is confaned to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number _f people. You mqy then wadk to the ecd of the syreet, and I will rejoon you!in ten m$nutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get@nuar the window, to watch you, and kt the signal to throw an this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wlit you at the corner of the street."

$Precisely."

"Them you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think,*perhaps$&it is almist time that I(preparf for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom-and returned in a few m)nutes in the character of $n amiable and simpfe-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broae clack hat! his baggy trou$crs, his white tiu, his sympathetic smile, qnd general look of peering ajd benevolent curiosity were subh as Mr. Joh Hare alone could have equamled. It was not merely that Holmes cha^ged his Sostume. is expressiin, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fxesh part tha$ he assumed. Dhe stage lost a fine actor, even as scie$ce lost an acute reasoner, when he beceme a specialist in crime.

It was a quarterpast six when we left Baker StBmet, and it still wanted ten miutes to the hour when we found ourselvdC in Serpentine Avenue. It was alrealy dusk, and the lamp$ were just being lighted as we paceb up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of0its occupant. The houue was just such a3 I had pictured it from Shorlock olmes' succinct description, but the mgcality appeared to be less private than I expected. Gc the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was!remarkably animaed/ There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking(and laughing in a corner,Â€a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen whn were flirting with a nurse-gir$, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and dowj with cigars i txeir mouths.

"Yoe see," remarked Ho|m${, as@we paced to and fro in front of the house, $this marriage rather simp,ifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that@she would be a$ averse to its beig seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of h	s princess# Now the question is, Whebe are e to find the photograph?"
"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large fo$ easy0concealment aboEt a woman's ress. She knows that the Ki$g`is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have alr$ady been made. We#may uake it, then, tha|$she doUs not carry it about with hur."

"Where, then?"

"Her bankev or her lawy%r. \here is that double`possibility. But I amiocline$$to think neither. Women aqe naturaly secrative, and they like $o do their nwn se$reting$ Why should she hand(itÂ€over to anyone else? She cnuld trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what ineirect or politmcal influence mmght be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved wo0use it within a few da$s. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgledn"

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you liok?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I vill get her to show me."

"But she$will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear&the rumble of wheels. It is her carriag$. Now carry out$my orders to the letter."

As he spoke th$ gleam f the sidelight$ of a carriage-came round the curve of the afenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulded u, one of the loafing men at t$e corner dashUd forward to@open the door in$the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by afother loafer, who had rushed up with the same )ntention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which wa{ increlsed fy the two guardsmej, who tooo sides with one of the loungers, a~d jy the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struckL and an an instant thh lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flusned and struggling men, who struck savagedy at fach other with theiB fists and $ticks. Holmes das($d )nto the crowd to protect`the lady; but, `ust as he`ruached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the groxnd, with tho blood running freely down his facd. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, whdle a number of better dressed peoqle, who ad watched the scu&fle without taking part in it, c2owded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man/ Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried u$ the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined again$t tke lights o$ the hill, looking back into the street.

"Is the pgor gentleman-much hurt?" she asked.

"Hd is dead," cried sUveral voices.

"No, no, there's life!in him!" shouted enother. "But he'll be gone before you can get him#to hospital."

2He's a brave fell$," $aid a wom'n. "They would have had the lady's purse and wa|ch if it hadn't feen for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathinW now."

"He cac't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring $)m into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please"

Slowly and sole-nly he was borne into Briony(Lodme and laid out ih the principal room, while I still observed rhe proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been fit, but the blinds had not been dragn, so that I could see Hol}es as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he0$as $eized with compunction at thit moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my&life$than when Y saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grase and kindliners with which she waited upon the injured -an. And yet it wold be thc blackest treachery#to Holmes t draw back now from the part which ee had int$usted to men I(hardened my heart, and took the umoke$rocket from under my $lster. After all, I thought, we are not inj}ring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat ut upon the couch, and&I saw him mopion like a man who is in need&of air/ A maid rushed across and t$xew open the window. At the same instant A {aw $im raise his(ha$d and at the signal I tossed ms rocket into the room with a*cry of $Fi$e!" The`word was nb so/ner out of my mouth than the whoae crowd of spectators, well dres$ed and ill--genlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a generl shrdek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of!smoke curled through the $oom and out at the open window. I caught a glimp$e of rushing figures, and a moment later the vohce of Holmes from within assuring them that it w!s a f!lse alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of 4he!strfet, and in ten minutes was bezoice$ to find my friend's#arm in mine, and to get away frm the scene og uproar. He walked swiftly amd in s	lenco for some few minutes until we had turned diwn one of the quiet s4reets which lead towards the Edgeware $oad.

"You did it verx nice|y, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."

"$ou Xave the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"Sho showed#me, asI told:you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wis to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "$he mater was perffctly simp$e. Yoe, of coxrse, saw that@everyone in the sreet was an accomplice. They were all mngaged for the eveming."
"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row brkke out, I had a litule moist red paint in the pam of my hand. ) rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my $kce, and Recame a p)teous!spectacle. It is an old trock."

"That also-I could fathlm."

"Then tney carried me in. She was bound to have me in. Whit else!could uhe do? And into her sitting-room,&which was the$very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to sem which. Teey laid me on a couch, I motio.hd for air, they were compelled to _pej the window, and you had y$ur chance."j
"How did that xelp you?"

"It was all-imp$rtan.#When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at oncf to rush to the thing which shd values most. It is k perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of$the Earlington Wubytitution Scandal it was of use to me, andalso in the Arnsworth Ckstle business.!A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-$kx. Now mt was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing )n the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. Uhe would rush to secure it. The alarm of f$re was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves0of steel. She responded beautifully. The photbgraph is Yn a recess behihd a sliding pknel just above the right boll-pull. 3he was there i~ an inptantL and C caught a glimpse of it as$she half drew it ou$. When $ cried out that it was a falsealarm, she replaced it, glanced ay the rocket, rushU$ from txe room, Qnd I Xave not seen ker since. I zose, a^d, m$king my excuses, escaped from the house. 	 hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin alf."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our qumst is practically finished. I shall call with tha King to-morrog, and with you, if you care to come with us.Â€We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but jt i~ pro$able hat when she comes she may find neiyher us nor the xhotogrbph. It might be $ satisfaction to his MQjesty to$regain yt with his own hands."

"And when Gill you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be p, pn that(we shall have a clea$ field. Besides, te must be pzompp, for this marri$ge mey mean a complete change in her life and habits. I musp wire ro the Kinc wythout delay."

We ha reached Baker Street ant had stopped at tXe door. He was searching hds pockets for the key when s$meone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlonk Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, bxt thu greet	ng appered to come from a slim youth in an xlster wbo had hurried by.

"I've hear$ that voi$e before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deu#e that could have been."

III.


I$slept at Baker Street thgt night, and we $ere engaged upon-our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of BohemYa rushed into the room.

"You ha~e really got it%" he Sried, graspin$ Sherlock Holmes "y either $houlder-and looking eage$ly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be g/ne."

"We must eave a Sab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descen$ed and started off once more for Briony Lodge.
"Irene Adler is married," relarked Holmes.
$"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But tg whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But whe could $op love hmm."

"I$a] in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majasty all fear gf future acnoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does hot l_ve your Majesty. If she does not love yoqr Majesty, there is no reason why she whould@interfere with your Majesty's plan."
$"Itis true. And yht--! Wel" I w$sh she had been of@my(own station! What a queen she would have made!" He rulapsed into a mood$ silence, which was not broken until we drew up yn Serpentine Avene.

The door of Briony Lodge was!open, and an elderly woman stood 5pon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

$I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and raDherHstartlUd gaze.

(Indeed! My mistress told me tiat you were likely to call.Â€She left this moning wih h$r husband by the 5:15 train from Chlrijg Cross for thh Continent."

"Wh$t!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white wi~h chagrin and sxrprise. "Do you iean that 9he ha$ left!England?"

"Never to retun."

"And the papmrs?" asked the King hoa2sey/ "All is lost.$

"We shall see." He pushed past $he servant and rushed into the d$awing-room, f/llowed by`the King an$ myself. The furhiture*was scat$ered about i^ overy di$ection, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, ks if tho lady had hurriedly ra.sacked them bevore her$flight. Holmes rvshed at the bell-`ull, tore back a small`sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of$Irne Adlr herself in evening dress, the letter wap superscribed to "Sherlock Holme~, Esq. To be left till called f$r." y friend tore it open, and we al$ three rea$ it together. It was dated at midni$ht if the preceddng nigbt end ran in this wat:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really eid it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not$a$suspiSion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against(you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it $ould certainly be you. And ylur address hqd been given me. Yet, with all tXis, you made me reegl qhat0you wanted to know. Even bfthr I b%came suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you kdow, I have been*~rained as an actr$ss myself& KalU costume is nnthing new to me. I often take adva(tage0of the freedom which it give~. I $ent John, the coachman, to watch yo, ran u}stairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came0down just as zou depavted.

"Well, $ followed you to your#door, and so made sure ~hat I was really an object f interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlo`k Holmes. Then I, radher imprudently,#wi$hed you good-night,`and started for the TempleAto see my husbknd.
"We both thought$the best resource was flight, when pursuet by so formidable an antagonist; o you will find t`e nest empty when you call tn-morrow. As to the photogBaph, your client may rest in teace. I love and-am loved by a better man than he. The King(may do what he will without hhndrance frm one whom he has cruelly wronged. I kehp it only to safeguard mysel&, and&to $reserve a weapon!which will always secure me@from any$sueps which he might take in tha future. I$leave a photograph which he might care to pssess; and I remain, dearMr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly youvs,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" crie$ tee King of Bohemia, $hen we had all threeread this epistle. "Did I not well you how quick and resolute he was? Would sh not!hbve ade an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was nkt on my level?"

"From what I have seen of ~he lady, sxe seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not#been able to bring y/ur Majesty's business to a mo2e successful conclusion."

&On the contrary, my dear sir," crieg*the King; "nothing could be more succ$r$ful. I know that her word as inviolate. The photograph is nlw as safe as if it were in t$e fire."

"I$am glad to hear your Maje$ty say so."

"I am immcnsely indebted to you. Pray telo me in what gay I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of eis hand.

"Your Majesty has romething which I shoumd value even more $ighly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at0him in amazement.

"Irene's photogzaph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then*there is no$more to ae done in the gattes. I have the honour tg wish you e very good-morning." He boweb, and, turning eway without obsarving the hand which the King had stretched out to$him, he set off in my company for his chambersn

And that was hkw a great $candal threatened to affect the kingdo$ of Bohemia, and how 4he best }l$n$ of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were bcaten $y a woman's wit.0He*used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I lave*not heard him do it#of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, jt ys always under th$ honourable thtle of the woman.

ADVENTURC  II.  \HE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one $ay in the autumn of la$t year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout$ florid-faced, elderly gentlemkn }ith fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion,`I was about to wi4hdr`w wheh Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and*closed the dor behind me.

"You could not possibly Yave come at&a better tim$, my dear Watson," he said corddally.

"I was afraad t$at ou were engaged."

"So I am. Very muih so."

"Then I can wQit in the next room."
"Not at all.(This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many0of my most successful cases, $nd I havo no doubt that he will be of the utmost usa to me in yours also."

The stiut gmnt$eman half rose fr_m his cha)r and gave a bof of greeting,&with a quick little questioning glance frbm his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsin$ into his armchair and puttyng his fingertips together, as was$his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear WaDson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrue r$utine ob everyday life. You have shown your relis$ $or it cI the enthusias$ which his prompted you tn(chronicle, and, if you wi|l$excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of ny own little adventures."

"Your cases have inleed been of the grearest interest to me,"I observed.

"$ou will remember thQt I remarked the other day, just before weÂ€went$ijto the vry simple prob$em*presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effacts and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, whych is always far more d$ring than any effort of the imaginitien."

"A ptoposition $hich I took the@liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doitorl but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I*shgll$keep on pilinc fact upon fact on you until yo5r reason $reaks$down under them and acknowlmdges ee to be rihtN Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here hasÂ€been good enoug` to call upon ne this morjing, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have \istdned`to for some time. You hbve@heard me remark that(the s$rangest and most unique&things are very ofen connfcted not with $he larger but with $hh smaller crimes, anl occasionblly/ indeed, where there Ys room for doubt whether any positiv crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is!impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of irime or not, but0the course of events cs cer4ainly among the most singular that I have ever listefed to. Perhaps,0Mr( Wilson, you would h$ve thU grear kindness t/ recommence yo5rjnarratd$e. I a~k you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar aure of the stoy makUu me anxious to have evexy poss	ble detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard yome slight indication of`the course of events, I am able to@guidm myself by the thousands0of other simyl!r cace$ which occur to my memory. In the present inwtnce I am forced to admit0t$at the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearanca of some little pride knd sulled a $irty andÂ€wrinkled newsp$per from the inside pocket on his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisemet column, with ho head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon hiw knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the&fasXion og my companion, to read the indications whic$ might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain veBy much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an a{erage commonplgce British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore qarher baggy grey shepherd&s checktrousers, a not over-clean$black frock-coat, unbuttonUd in the front, and a drab waistcoat wit` a heavy hrassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit0of metal danfling dlwn as an or$ament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcgat wit a wrinkled velvet collar lay upkn a chair bdside him. Altogeth%r, look as I }iuld, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagri. bnd discoctent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took ic my occupation, and he rhkom his0head with a smile as eÂ€$otieed my questioning glanceC. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time donu manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he xas buen if China* and thad he has done a con$iderable amoumt0of writingÂ€lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson srarted up ij his chair, with his fo$efinger uon the paper, b$t h$s eyes upoo my companion.

"How, yn the name of good-fortune, did you know all 4hat, Mr. Holmes?" he acked. "How did you knlw, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's c$rpenter."

"Your hanes&my dear sir Your right hand!i{ {uite a size larger tha^@your left. You have wosked with id, and the muscles are more developed."

"Weol, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry2"

"I won't insult your inthlligence by telling you how I read tnat, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpic."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. B5t the writing?"
"What else can be-indicated by thbt right cuff 3o very shiny for five inches, and the left one with t$e smooth patc`!near the elbow where yu reCt it upon tXe desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your rcght wrist could only have been done an China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have uven c$ntributed to the literature of the subject. Thbt trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculoar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coyn hanging from your watch-chain, the }aDter becomes even mnre simple."

Mr. Jabez Gilson laughed `eavily. "Well, I nevhr"# said h%. "I0thought at first that you had done somuthing clever, bet I se$ that there wa$ nohing in it after all."

"	 "egin to think, Watson," said Holmfs, "that I make a ]iutake in explaining.#'Omne ignotum tro magnifico,' you know, and my pokr little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you nt find#the a`vertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, $ have got!it now," he amsw$red with his thick red finger plantedhalfqay down the column. "Here it is. Thys is what beg$n ct all. You just read it for yourselb, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RDD-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the baquest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a sal$ry of $4 a week for purejy nominal services. All red-headeT men who are sound in body and micd and abovt the age$of tweoty-one years, are eligiblc. Aply!in person on Mofday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Zoss, at the offices ol he League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
"What on earth does this$mean?" I ejac$lated aftmr I had twice qead over the extraordinay announcegent.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in hYah spirits. "It is a little off tbe beaten tback, isn't it?" said he& "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about-yourself, your household, and the effec4 hich this advertis%ment had upo. your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of tne paper and the date."

"It is The Morning(Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Jxst two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is jEst gs I have been telling you, Mr. Shero_cS $olmes," s!id Jabez Wilson, mopping`his forehead; "I have a small pawnbr_ker's Rusiness at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, bnd of late years it has not done more than just give me i jiving. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only!keep one; and I would ha~e a job to pay him aut that he is willing to come for ha
f wages so as to learn the business."

"What i$ the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His mame is Vincent(S$aulding, and he'p jot cuch a youth$ ether. It$s hard to say his age. I shuld not wish a smarter a$sistqnt, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better!himself and earn twice what I am ablc to give him. But, ifter all, if he is satisfiee, why should I put ideas in `is*hea`?"

"Why,&indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among $mploier$ in thds age. I don't`know that you assistant is not as rUmarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he $as his faults, $oo," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ouglt to be improving iis mind, and(then diving down into the cellar lYke a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his m$in fault, out on the whole he's a god woker/ There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"$es, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple co$king and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I amÂ€a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, si$, th$ three of us; and we keep  roof0over our heads qnd p$q or debts, if we d	 noth$g gore.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, le #ame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he siys:

" 'I Gish&to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I a$k{.
" 'Why<' says he, 'here'sÂ€another vacancy on the Leaxe of ~he Red-headUd Mej. It's worth quite a l$ttle fortune to any man w$o gets@it, and I understand that theru are&mre vacancies than there are men, so that the tuspees Qre at their wits' end what to do with phe money. Cf my hair would ofly change colour, herh's a n$ce(little crib aml ready fos me to step into.'
" 'Why- what is it, then?'I asked. You see, Mr. Hommes,I am aÂ€very stay-at-home man, !nd as my business came to me instead of my hafing to go to it/-I was oftUn weeks on*end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that say I dydn't know much of what was going on o$tside- and I was always glad of(a bit of news.

" 'xgve you#never`heaqd of the League@of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with h)s eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why- I wonder at(that, for you are eligible yeurself for one of the vacancies$'

" 'And what are they woryh?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a yhar, but the work is slight, and it need not in4erfere#very much with one's other ockupatjons.'

"Well, you can easily thmnk that th`t made me pbick up my ears, for th$ busine$s has not been over good for!some years, an$ an e$tra couple of hundred would have beUn very handy.

" 'Tell me all about0dt,' said I.

" '_ell,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that tle League has a vaca$cy, and there $s the agdress where you sxould apply-for-varticulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an America$ millionaire,@E|ekiah Hop$ins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He washimself red-headed, and he@had a great sympathy `oz all red%headed men; s$, whan he died, itwas found that he had left his Unormous fortune in the hands of trustee~, 7ith in~t2uctio.s to0appl9 the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splcndid pay and fery little to do.'
" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would bpply.'

" 'Not so$many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it Ys really cohfinel to Londoners, and to grown m$n. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted o tothe old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use Iour qpplyin$ jf your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, ficry ree Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would jst walk in; dut perhaps it $nuld hardly bu worth your while to vut your$elf ut of rhe qay for the sake of a few hundred po$nds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemej- as you maI see for youselves,$that my hair is of a$very full and rich tint, so that it seemed Do me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I sto_d as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to $cow $o much about it that I thought he`might prove useful, so I just orderet him to*put up the shu$ters for thU day and to come right awaz with me. He was very willing to havea holiday, so we shut the business up#and started nff for t$e address t(at was given us i~ thh advertise$%nt.

"I never hope to see such a(sight as that Qgain, Mr. Holmes. Fxom north, south, east, and west everi man who$had a shade on red in $is haYx had trampedinto the city to answer the advertisemenu. Fleet Sdreet was choked with red-headed folk! and Pope's Court lioked liko e coster's oracgu barrow. I should not have thought there wure so many$in the whele country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of-colour they were--~traw, lemon, orange, brick, Ir	sh-setter, liver, clay; but, as$Spaelding sain, there were not mans who had the real viuid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how$many were waitihg, I would have gjven it up in despair; but Pzauldi^g woul` .ot hea$ of it. How he did it I could not0imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and roglt up to the steps which led to thf office. There $as  double stream upon&the stair, some goinW up in hope, and some c$ming back dejucted; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most dtertaining oe," remarked Holmes as his client paesed and refreshed nis memory with a huge pinch of sn5ff. "Pray iontinue your very interesting statement&"

"T$ere was nothing in te office$but a couple of wooden chairs and b deal table, behind which sat q-small man with a head that was even!redder than mine. He s$id a fewÂ€words to eac$ ca$didate as he came up, and then he alwlys manag%d to find0some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did nit seek tk be such a very@eary matter, after $ll.@However, when our turn came the$\ittle man&was much moro favourable$$o me tha. to any of the othes, and he c$oset the door as we entered, so tha$ he might have a private $ord w$t$ us.

" 'This js $r. Jabez Wilson,' said mt assistant, #and he i willing to Vmll Q vacancy in the League.'

" 'And he0is admirably0suited for it,' the other !nswered.-'He has every requiremUnt. I kannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head@on one side, and g!zed at my hair until I felt quYte bashful. Then sudde.ly he plunged forward,#wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.$
" 'At wguld be injustice!to hesitate,'Â€sad he. 'You will, howev$r, I am(sure( excuse me for takong an obvious pre$aution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged unwil I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I zerceive that all is as#it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have 4wice been deceived by wigs`and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax wh)ch would disgust you with human n$ture.' He stapped ovfr to the windo$ and shoutee through it at the top of his voice that the $acancy was filled. A groan og disappointment came up from below, and the!folk all trolped away in different directions $ntil there was not g red-head to be seen except mq own and that of the mana$er.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr.Duncan Toss, and I am myself one of the&pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a martied ma$, Mr. Wilson? Have yuu a family?'

"I answeBed tlat I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" GDear$me!' h$ said gra~ely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the*propagation aod spread of thU red-heads as vell $s for theirÂ€mkintenance. It Ys@exceedingly unfortEnato#that you should be e bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, bor*I though| that I was nor to have the vacQncy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutep he said that it would be all right.

" 'In the cas% of anoter,' said he,#'the objection might be fatal, but we must stre$ch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair ap yourc. When shall you be able to ejter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have g(business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind aboud!that, 2. Wilson!' said Vincent Spguldicg. 'I shoule be able to hook after that for you.'

" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Noz a pawnbrojer's bus$ness is `ostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especdally Thursday an$ Fridaz eveninj, which is just refore pay-dky; so it wguld suit me very well to earn a little in$the morings. Besides, I knew that mz$assistant was a good man, and that hewould see to anything that turned up.

" 'That ould suit m% very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

" 'Is $0 a week.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is purely no`inal.'

" 'What do you call puruly nominal?'

" 'Well, you have to be in the offcce, er a least $n the building, the whole rime. If you leave, you f$rfeit your whole position&forever. The will is vexy clear upo~ yhat point. You don't comply with the conditions if you buege from the office during that time.'

" 'It$s only four hour3 a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said`I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' saYd Mr. Dxncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you@must stly, or you lose your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica/ There is the first volume of it in that press. You must finl your own ink, p$ns, and $lotting-paper, but we provide t`os table and chair. Will you be ready@to-motrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wi$son, ann let me congratulate yox once more on the#important position wh	ch you have been fortunate enough to-gain.' He fowed me@out of tho ro$m and M went home with my`assistant, hardly knowing what t say or do* I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the ma|tfr all day, ane by eveoinW I wa$ in low spiriDs again; fo I had quite persuaded mysalf that the $hole affair mvstbe slme great ho|x or fraud, though 7hat its object might te I could not imagima. It seemed altogether papt belief that anyone coujd make suc a will, or t`at they would$pay such a sum for doing anythin$ so simple ar $$pying$out the Encyclopaedia Britannicq. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to chder me u$,!but by bedtimm$I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the m$rning I determinedÂ€to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a pe$ny bottle $f ink, an$ with a quill-$en, acd seven sbaets of foolscapÂ€paper, I started off for Pope's C$urt.

"Wall, to my svrprise and delight, everything was as ig$t `s pousible. The table was set out ready for -e, and Nr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I g_t fai$ly to wor$.He start$d me off upin tXe letter A, and than he l$$t me6 but he would drop in from time to time to see that(all was right with me. A~ two o'clock he bade me g$od-day, complimented me upen th amount that I!h$t writte$, and locked the door of the$office aftr me.

"This w$nt on day after d`y, Mr. Holmes! and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golnen sovere$gns for my week's work. It was the$same next $eek, and the same t$e week after. Evety mor$ing I was thmre at ten, and every a$ternoon I left at*two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, `fter a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I newer dared to leave the room for an inst$nt, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good@one, and ru	ied me so well, that I would not risk the loss*o$ it.

"Eight weeks&passed a}ay like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and ArmourÂ€and ArchitecDure and Attica, and hoped sith diligence that I$might get on to teU B's before$very long. It gost me somethhng $n foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my$writings. And then suddenly the whole bus$ness came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later then this morning. I wentÂ€to my work s usual at ten oGclock, but the door was shut and locked, titX a-little square of cardboard hammered on to tne middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can rad foB yourself."

He held up a piece of white!cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read )n this fashion:


THE!RED-HEADED LEAG$E

IS

DISSOLVED.

ctober 3, 1890.


Sherfo$a Holmes and I surveyed this curu announc$ment and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely $vertoppeg evety gthe consideration that we both durst out into a soar of laughter.

"I cannot sec that here is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugx at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," criod Holmes, shoving$him back into the chair frol which he had halb risen. 2I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is io3t refreshi$gly unusual. But t$ere is, if you will excuse my $$ying so, somethcng just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take whe. you found Dhe card upon$the door?"

"I qas staggered, s$r- 	 did not know what to do. Then I called at the ofbices round, buw none of them seem$d to know anything about $t. Finall9, I went to rhe landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground$floor* and I asked him if he could tell me }ht*had become of the Red-headed League. Ke said that hU had never heard of any ssch body. Then I a{ked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. @e answered that the name wasnew to him.

"$'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. T.'j
" 'What< the red-beaded man?'

" !Yes.'

" 'O(,' said he, 'his$name was William Morsis. He was a solicitor and was u$ing gy room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He&moved outÂ€xestorday.'

" 'Where could I find hcm?'

"&'Oh, at his .ew offices. He did tell me the addreus. Yes, 17 King Edward Street$ near St. Pal's.'

"I srarted off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address $t was a manufactory of artivicaal knee-caps, and no one in it had fver heard of either Mr( William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I wend home to Saxe-Cobug Square, and I too[ the advice of my assistant. But Xe sovld n$t help me in-any wa. He$could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I*did not wish to lose suc a place without a struggle, so, as I hid heard that you we$e good Umough to give advice to poor folk w$o were in need of it, I came right$away to you."

"And you did ver$ wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is$an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy t fonk into it. From what you have told me I thinm that it is possible that gravev issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mb. J$bez gilson. "Wh, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are persona|ly concerned," remarked Hoames, "I do$not sae that you have any grievance against this extraordinary loague. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute $nowledge whic$$you have gained en every subjoct which comes u~eer the letter A* You have lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. I4 w$s a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them&two and thirt$ posnds."

"We shall enddavour to clear up these pints for you. And, `irst, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your ettentio$ $o(the advertisement--how&long had he been vith you?"

"About a monte then."

"How did he come9"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only$appljcant?"

"No, D had a dozen."

"Why di you pick him?"

BUcause he was handy and would coe che$p."

"At h`lf wegUs, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he l$ke, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on nis face, though he's noD short of thirty/ Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in cons$derabme excitement. "I thought as mech," said he. "Have you ever observed tat his eas are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep th$ught. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only ju{t left him."

"$nd has your busi.ess been attended to in your absenee?"

"Nothing to complain o, sir. Dhere's never0very much to do of a morning."

"That will o, Mr. Wilson. I shall $e happy to give you an opinion upon $he subzect in the course of a*day or$two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we mby come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watsnn," said HolmeC when our visitor had left us/ "what do you make of it all?"

"I make n_thing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule,(said Holmes, "the mord bizarre a thing is the lesp mysterious it proves tb be. It is your commonplacc, featurele$s crimes which a$e really puzzlyng, just as a ck`monplace face is rhe most difficult to identify. But I must Re prompt over$this matter."

"W(at are ynu going to do, then?" I asked.
$"To smoke," he ansGered. "It is quite a three pcpo problem, and D$beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes."-He $urlud0himself up in his chair, with his thi~ onees drawn up ti his hawk-like nose, and there he sat wih his eyes closed and his blach clay pipe thrusting out*like the bill of some strange bird. O had come to the conclus$on that he$had dropped asleep, and i$d$ed@was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man 7ho has made up his mind*and put his pipe down upon thc maotelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the St/ Jam$s's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothicg to do to-day. My practice is ne6er pery absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am Woing through the City vmrst, and we can have some lunch on the way. M observe $hat there is a good dea$ of German music o$ the programmel which iy rathermore to my taste than Italian or Nrench. It is introsqective, and D want to introspect. Coma along!"

We travelled by the Underground !s far as Aldersgate; and  short walk took us to Saxe-C_burg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby+ge~teel place, where four lines of dingz two-storied brick houses looked out int$ a small railed-in enclocure, wheqe a0lawn of weedy gr$ss and a few clumps of faded laurel*bushes made a hard fight against a smokd-laden !nd uncongenial atmosphe$e. Three gilt balls and a browj board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upo^ a corner ouse, announced the place where our $ed-headed clhent carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped hn front of it with his head on one sibu and looked it all over, with his eyes shoning brightly between-puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down`again to the@corner, still lo$king keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon$the pavement wiDh his s~ick two or three thmes, he went up to!the door and knocked. It`was instahtly $pened by a bright-looking, clhan-sxaven young fellow, who asked him to#step i.

"Teank you," said Holmes, "I o~ly wished to ask yoe how you would go fro- here to the Strand."

"TXird right, fourth left$" answeret the assistant promp$ly, closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," o"serfed Holmes as we walked away. "He $s, in my judgment, dhe fou$th smarteCt man in London, and for daring I am not sure t$at he has not a claim to be third.(I have known something ef him be&ore."
"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the*Red-headed Oeague. I am sure that you in$uited$your way merely in order(|hat you might $ee him."

"Not hi$."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."
:"And w$at d$d you see?"
$"What I expectdd to see."

2Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, tlis is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spie~ in an enemy's counpry. We mnow&something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented ks great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to thU back. It was one of the main artfries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north ani west. The roadway&w`s bd$cked with the immense stream$of commerce flowing in ` dou$le tide inward and outwird, while t`e footpaths wer$ black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficul 5o realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business }remises that they reglly abutted on the other siie upon tXe faded and stegnant {quare which we `ad just quitted.

"Lep me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancijg&along $he line, "I should like just to rdmember the oqder of the houseC here. It is e0hobby of mine to haveÂ€an exact knowledgh of London. There is Mortimer'p, thet$bacconist, $he oittle new$paper rhop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant- bnd LcFarland's carriage$bui|dinj depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our wor$, so it's time we had some play. A*sandwmch and a cup of cof$ee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness knd delicacy and harmony, a$d there are no red-neaded clihnts to vex us with their cnnundBums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, beinm him~elf not only i very cap$cle performer but a composer$o` / ordinary merit. A$l the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently wavang his long, thin fingers in tyme*to the music,w$ile his gently smilong face and his languid, dreamy eyes were $s unlik% thl$e of Holme3 the#sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed riminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular eharacter the dual nat$re alternately asserted itself, and his extr$me exactness!and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the&reaction against t$e poetic an$ contemplative mood which occasionill9 predominated in him* The swing of his nature took him from extrame languor to devouring energy; and$ as I knew well, he wasnever so truly formidable as when, for days o. end, he had been loungdng in his armchair amid his imvrovisa$$ons and his black-letteb edit	ons. Then ip was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and!that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the levml f int$ithon, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would l_ok askance at him as on a man whose knowledg$ was not that of /ther mortals. When I saw him that afternoo^ so enwrapped in the musi` at`St. Jam$s's Haol I felt that an evil time m$ght be coming upon those whom he had set hi`self to hunt down$

"You sant to(do home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked es we em$rged.

"Yes, it would be as woll."

"And $ have some business todo $hich wjll take some hours. This business at $oburg Square is`seriot{."
$"7hy serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contenplation. Ihavm every reason to believe $hat we shall be in time uo stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicayes marters. I shall want your help tonight."

Ap what time?"

"Ten wil be$early enkugh."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say$ Doctor, there |ay be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in our pocket." He waved his hand, tErned in his heeo, and $isappeared in an instant among the crowd.

I trust that H a} nt more dense than my neigibour$, but I was!always opxvessed with a sense of my ow$ stupidity )n my dealings with Sherlock Ho$mes. Here 	 had heard what he had$heard, I had seen what e had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what hld iappened but zhat was about to happen, while tk me the whole bu{iness was still#congused and gr$tesque. As I drove `ome to my houe in Kensington I thought over it all, frgm the extvaordinary story of the red-headed copoer of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Squabe, and the ominous vods with which he had parted from-me. What was this noeturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were wc $oing, and whap were we to do? I had the hinD(from Holmes&that t`is smooth-faced pawnbboker's asuistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I trie$ to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the }atter aside until night@should bring ac explanation.

$t was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my wax across the Qark, and so throum Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hbnsoms were utanding $t the door, and as I entered the passage I heard Dhe(sound of voices froe above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in ajimQted conversation with two men, one of whom I recogniren as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was(a long, thin, sad-f$ced0man, whth a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is com@lete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.0"Wa|son, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce ynu to Mr. Merrweat$er, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequentYal way$ "Our friend here is a wonderful man fr staxting a chase. Alj hc wants is an old dog0to help (im to do the running#down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our`cias$," ob$erved Mr. Mezryweatheq gloomily.

"You lay place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police a$ent loftioy. "He has his own little methoTs, which are, if heÂ€win'$ min$ my saying so& just alittle too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detectcve ij him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more ne$rly correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jooes, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I sonfess $hat I miss my rubbe$. It is the first Saturday nig(t for seven-and-twenty years that I have not `ad my rubber."

"I think you wilo find," said Sherlo$k Holmes, "tXat you will play#for g high$r stake to-night than you have ever done ye4$ and th!t the play zill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30$000; and for!yox, Jones, it will be the man upon who} you wisb 4o $ay your hanns."

"Jo$n Clay, the murderex, thief,&smasher, end forger. He's a young man, Mr. MeBryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, anT I would rather have myÂ€bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal dukf, and he himself has been to uton and O$fori. xis brain is as cunning$as his fingers, and though we meet signs of hom at every uurn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland bne 7eek, and be raisi~g money to build an rphanage in Eornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on$him yet."

"I hepe that I may eave the pleasure of introd$jng you to-night. I've had one or two little turn$ alsl with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It$is past ten, however, and quite time tha$ we started.$If you two will take the(&irst hansom, Watson and M will follow in the second."

Sherlock Hol$es was not vfry c$mmunicatmve during the long drmve and$lay back in the ca$ hulming thetunes whic` he kad heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless#labyrinth of gas-lit stree4s ntil we emerged intl Farrington Street.

"7e ire clkse$there nom," my$friend remarked. (This fellow Merryweather is a bank director,0and`personally interested in the matter. I thoug$t it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellew, though ad absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his c$aws pon anione. Here we are,$and they are wgiting for us."

We had reachfd the same@crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in thm morn	n$. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following`the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passcd down $ narrow passage and through a side$door, which he opened for u. Within therf was a small corrcdor, w$ich0ended$in a very iassiva iron gate. This`also was $pened, and led down a flight of wmnding!stone steps, which termonated at adother bormidable gate$ Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern( and0then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a $hird door, into a huge vault or cellar, whmch was piled all$round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not*very vulnerabl$ from(abovc," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern ane gazed about hii.

"Nor$from celow," said Mr.Merryweather, stri[ing has stick upon the flags which!lined the floq. "Shy, deas me, it sounds quite ho|low!" he remir[ed,0looking up in surprise.

"I must really gsk you to be a littl% more quiet!" said Homes severely. "You have already impeilled the whole success o` our expedition. Might I beg that you Gould&have the goodness to sit down upon`one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather per`hed himself upen a craDe, wirh a very injured expression upon his face, whije Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the \antern and a magnifying lens, began to examine$minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he0sprang toÂ€his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have0at least an hour befoBe us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps unt)l the $ood pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a }inute, for the sooner they do thcir work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are*at present, Doctor--as no doubt you`have divine--in Dhe cellqr of the City brbnch of ene of the princdpal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is txe chairman of directors( and he will expfain to you that there are rea3ons why0the more darin crimina\s of Loddn sh$uld tako i considerable inyerest in this cellar`at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several wlrnings that `n attempt might be madu upon it."

"Your French aold?"

"$es# We had occasion some months afo to strengt(e$ our resources and borrowed forthat purpose 30,001 $apoleon~ from uhe Bank of France. It$has become knozn that we have never had ogcasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,080 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larges at `rese$t than iusually kept ic a single branch office, and the dyrectors have had misgiings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justif$ed," o$se2ved Holmes/ "And now it is time that we arranged our$little plans. I expect that wit$in an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must $vt the$screen over that dark lantern."
"And sit0in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, y$u might have qour rubber after lll. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that$we cannot risk thd presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though w% shall take them at a disa$vantage, they may do us some harm unless we ere careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselvhs behind thosf. Theh, when I flash a lighp upon them, close in swif$$y. If they f)re, Watson, have $o$compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolvet, cocked, up$n the top of the wooden case behind hich I crouched. HolmesÂ€shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch daBkness--such an absolu$e darkness as I have never before experienced.@The $mell of hot metal remained to assuro us that the light was stihl there, ready to flash out a| a moment's notice. To me, with my nerv$s wotked u to a pitch of expectQncy, there was something depressing and suoduing in the suddeh jlokm, and in the co\d dank$air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whisperod Holmes.@"That is back through the house into SaxeCob}rg Square. I hope that you have done what I apked you, Jones?"
J"I have an insvUctor and#two okficers waiting at the frontÂ€door."

"Then we have stopped(all the h$les. And now we -ust be#silent and wait.*

What a time$it seemed! From compari.g no~es afterwards it was b5t an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night mus$ have almost$gone/ and the dawn be breaking$gbve us. Mymimbs wee woary and stiff, for I feared to change my positibn; yet my nervms were worked us-to the highest pi$ch of tension, and my `earing was Co ac$te that I could not only hear the gentle breat$ing of my companions, but I could distinguish the dee$er, heavier in-breath of the belky $ones from the thin, sighing note of yhe bank dhrector. From mz position I coxdd look over the case in the direction of tke fl_or. Suddenly my eyes caught the dlint of l lighw.

At fist it was but e lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Th$n it lengthe~ed gut until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a$gash seemed to open and a hand ap$eared, a white, almost womanly hand, ghich felt about in the bentre of the little are$ of light. For a minute or moe the $and, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then$it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again s!ve the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disa`pearance, however, was but momentary. With a ren$ing, tearing sound, one of the broad,#white stones turnei over upon its siie gnd left a square, gaping hole, th$ougn whoch streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edg% there peeped a cfean-cut, boyish face, which looked keen|y about mt, and$then, with a hand on either*side of the aperture, drew itself shbu$de-high and waist-high, until oneÂ€knee rested upon the edge. Dn another instant he stood at rhe side of the hole and was haulinc after him a comxancon, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a {hock of very red hair.

"It's `ll clear," ho-whispered. "Have you the chisel an` the bags? Gread Scott! Jump, Krchae, jump, and I'll(swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes hadsprung out and seizet the intruder by th% collar. The other dived down the hole, and I hearl the sound of rending cloth $s Jones&clutched at his`skirts. The light$lashed Epon!the barrel of a revolveq, but Holmes'*hunting crop came d$wn on the man-s w2ist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay,! said Holmes blandly. "Y$u have n$ chance#at all."

"Si I see," the other answered with the utmost coolnes. "I fancy phat my `al$is all rygh$, tXnugh I see you have got his coat-tails."
:"There re three men waiting for$him at the dokr," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to ha~e done the thing very completely. I must#compliment you."

"And I you," H$lmes answered. "Your red-heaned idea was rery new and effe#tiv$."

$You'll see your pal again presently," sayd Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the(derbics."

"I bfg that you will nop touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clatt%xed upon&his wrists. "You mqy not "e aware tnat I ha$e royal blood in my(veins. Have the goodness, also, when you iddress me always tk say 'sir' Qnd 'please.' "

"All right,*@said Jones-with a stare and a snygger. "Well, sould you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to(carry your Highness to$the po$ice.stition?"

"hat is better," said John Claz serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the txree of us and walked quietly`off in the cuswody of the detective.

"Really- Mr. Holmes,"-said Mr. Merry$eather as we followmd them from the c$llar, "I do nit know how t(e bamk can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of tne mos$ deermined attempts at bank rohbery that ha6e ever come within my experience."

"I have ha$ one$or two little scores of my(own to settle with Mr#`John Clay," said$Holmes. "I have been at s$me small ex$ense over this matter, which I#shafl eupect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an exserience which is in ma$$ ways uncque, and by hearing the very remarkableÂ€narrative of$the Red-headed League."
	"You see, Watson," he exqlained in the farly hours of the morning as we sat overa glass of whisky and soda i$!Baker Street, "iu was perfectly obvious from the firut that the only possidle object of this rther fantqstic business of the a$vertisement $f the $eague! and the copymng of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this noy over-brighy pawnboker out of th% way for a number of hours evey day. It was a curious way of managijg@it, but, really, it woulg be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt sugg$sted po Cfay's ingenmous mind by the $olour of his accomplica's hair. The $4 a wfek was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one xogue has the temporary office, the other rogue iocites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence crery morning in the week. From the time $hat I heard ofthe assistant having cme for half wages, it was obvio}s to ke tat he had some strong motive for sesuring the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been womfn cn the house, I sho$ld have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, howev$r, way out of the queCtion. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his hous which bould accoent fer such eaaborate preparations, ang such !n expenditure as hey were at. )t must, then, be something out of the house. What could it&be? I0tho$ght of the assistan$-s fondness for photography, and his wrick of va~ishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end $f this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as $o this }ysteious assistant and found that I hld to deaj with one of the coolest and most daring cr$minals in London. He was doing something in the cellar$-someticng which took many hours a day for months on end. What coul$ it be, once more? I kould$think of nothing sare that he was running a tunnel to some0othhr building.

"So far C had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon dhe pavement with my stick. I$wis ascertaijing whether the cel\ar stretchei out in front ot bfhind. It gasnot&in fron4. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, theassistant ans$ered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never0set fies upon each other before. I hardly looked at hisÂ€face. His knees zere what ) wished to see. You must$yourself heve remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained@they were. They spokm of t$ose hours of burrow$ng. The only re$lininc point was what they were burrowing for. C walked rouhd the corner, saw the City !nd Suburban Bank abutded on our friend's premises, and ffdt that $ lad so\ved my poblem. When you$drove home after the0conert I called upon Scotland Yard ajd upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the $esult that you have seen."

"And how could(you tell t`at they would make their a$tempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they c$osed their League offices that was ` sign that they carod no longer about Mr. Jab$z Wilson's presence--in odher worts, that thmy had $ompleted their ttnnel. But(it was esse^tial that they shold use it soon, as it midht be discovered, or the bulloon might be removed. Saturday would$sui$ them better than any other day, as it would give them two d!ys for their escape. Fr all these reasons I expested them to Somf to-night."

"You reasoned it oy beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is ro long a chain, and yet every li$k rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he an$wered, ygwning. "Alas! I qlreQdy feel it closing in upon me.$My lige is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. The$e little`problems help me todo so."

"And you are a benefactorÂ€of the race," said y.

He snrugged his$shou$ders$ "Well, pmrhaps, afthr all,#i$ is of some little u$u," he remazked. " GL'homme c'est rien-l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY


"Mi dear fe,lowl"$said Sburlock Holmes as we-sat on either side of-the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely!stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. ge would not dave to conceive the things which are really mere commonpoaces of existence. If we cguld fly out of tkat window hand in hand,$hover over this gr%at city, $ently remove the roofs, acd peep in at the $ueer yhings$which are!going(on, the strange coincidences, the planncngs$ the cross-purposes, the wonderfsl chains of events, working through generations, an$ leading to thU most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and forese$n conclusions most s|ale and unprofitable$"

"K$d yet I am nt convinced of $t," M answered.$"The sases which come to light in the papers bre, ac a rulel bald*enogh, and vulgar enough. We have hn our poldce reports realism pushed to its fxtreme lhmits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fasciatihg nor@artistic."

"A certain seleStion and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," r$marked Holmes. "This is wanting in the p_lice report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the0detaYls, which t/ an obsetver contain the vital essence of t$e whole matter. Depend upon it, th%re is nothing so unnatu2al as the commonplace."

H smiled and shook my head. "O $an quitm understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your posytion of unofficial adviser and heaper to everybody who*is absolutely puzzled, tbroughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up te morning paper from the grouod-$"let us put it to a ptactical test. Here is the first heading upon wh$ch I ceme. 'A hu$band's cruelty to his wife.' Yhere is$half a column of print, but I know without reading it thgt it is all perfect|y familiar to me/ Theru is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, thd blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister o$ landlady. The crudest of writers could invent noth$n$ more crude."

"Indeed, youx example is an*unfortunate one for you$ argEm$nt," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down i~. "This is thd Dundap separation case, and,$as it appejs$ O was engagfd in clearing up some small points$in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, thee was fo other woman, and the bonduct complained of was ~$at he had drifted $nto the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his fafse weeth and hurling`them at his wife, which, you will al\ow, is not an action likely to occur to the i$agination of te average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledgeÂ€that I have ~eored over&you in youq example."

He held out $is sn}ffbox of old gold, with a$great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour waC in such$contrast to0his homely ways and simple life that y could not help co$menting up. i|.

"Ah," said hu, "I forgot that I had n$t seem you for some weeks. It is a little souve^ir from the King of Boemia in return for my assistance in the case of t(e Irene Adler piper$."
"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable bril,iant which spbrkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reignyng family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicaSy t$at I cannot confide it even to you, who have bUen good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you an$ on and just now?" I asked wcth int$rest.

"Some ten or twelve, bu$ none which present any feature of interest. They@are important, you understand, wathot being interestyng. IndeUd, I have found that it is usually in*unimporta~t matters that tXere is a fie\d for the observation, and for the $5ick analy$is of iause and effecy which gives the charm to an investiga4ion. The larger criles are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is whe mouiFe. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter whichÂ€has been ref%rred to me from Marseillas, teere is nothing whicb p2esents any features!of interest. It is posshble, howeve$, that0I kay have something bettcr before very many mijutes are over, for this is one of my*clients,or#I am much0mistake$."

He had risen from his chair and vas standing $etween the pbrte$ blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinteT London street. Looking /ver his should_r, I saw that!on the pa6ement`opposite there stood a large woman iyh a heavy0fur boa round her neck, nd a large curling red feather@in a broad.brimmed hat which was tilteb in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peetfd up in a oervous, hesitating fashio. at our windows, while her body osillated0backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttos. Suddenly,$with a plunge, as of the swim}er who leives the bank, she hurried across the road,$and we hear$ the sharp clang of the bell.

"C have se$n those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigareDte into phe fire. "Oscillation upon the pavhment always means an affaire d% coeur. She would like advice, buu is not sure that the matter is not too del	catc for communic!tio$. And yet even hhre we may diskriminate. When Q woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom!is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is $ love matter, but that the mgiden is nod so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But hhre she comey in person to resolve our do$bts."

As!he spoke thexe was a tap at Dhe door, and the boy in buttons entered to $nnounce Miss Mary`Sutherland, while the \ady `erself loomed behind his small bleck fcgure lik$ a full-sailed merchant-mln behind a tiny pilot boat. Phrlock Holmes welcomed her with t(e@ea$y courtesy for$which he was remarkble, and, having clised the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstrbcted f`shion whieh war peculigr to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with yiur short shght it is a little trying to do so muc$ typ$wriring?"

"I did at first*" she answeed, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, sugdenly realising tXe full purport of his words, she $ave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her $riad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. olmes," she cqied, "el$e how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know tXing. Perhaps I-hape&trained mysehf to see whqt others overlook# Cf not, why should you come to cons}lt me?"

"I came to qou, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs.$Utherege, whose husband you founn so easy(when$tie police and everyonU@had given hig up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I-wih you would do as much fr ma. I'm not rich, but still I have&a hundred a year in my own rc$ht, besi$es the little that I make by the machine, and`I would give it all to know what has becnme of M. Hosmhr Angel."
